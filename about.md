Hi, my name is Hyunjong Park, a Senior Analyst, Data Science in GADM team at IATA, located in Montréal, Canada.
I started my career as a flight dispatcher at Korean Air. If you find career changing stories interesting, you might like mine as well.

I started learning computer science at University of California, San Diego. San Diego is a beautiful place by the way.

But I decided to transfer to Korea Aerospace University after I finish my military duty. There were a number of reasons why I decided to do so, but my major nor the university was one of them. Anyways, I graduated with a degree in air transportation at Korea Aerospace University and started working as a flight dispatcher at [Korean Air](https://www.koreanair.com/kr/ko). Being a flight dispatcher was an interesting and intriguing as it required never-ending decision makings due to the constantly changing flight conditions.

After few years of flight plannings for pilots, I decided to become a pilot myself. I quit the job and went to a flight school in Texas. The training seemed to be going pretty well. I earned my private pilot’s license in about 3 months.

**_Well, that was only until the outbreak of COVID-19._**

The school closed down and the aviation industry went serious downfall as we all know. My plan of becoming an airline pilot was ruined. I was pretty stressed out with the whole situation. Fortunately though, I was offered to work at an airline startup in Korea, called [Air Premia](https://airpremia.com/), as a safety planning manager.

My primary job was to build a safety management system of the company. Naturally, I got to work with our IT department a lot. Seeing all the software engineers coding on a dark screen using fancy mechanical keyboards brought all the memories I had when I was studying computer science back in UCSD. I think it really lit the fire in my heart or something.

With the pandemic lasting much, much longer than everyone had expected, my eagerness to begin a new journey as a software engineer grew larger. I grabbed my old books from college and started studying C again (and python, obviously). I was not sure how to change my career to a software engineer so I called everyone I knew for an advice. After months of desperate opportunity seeking, I was lucky enough to get a chance for an interview at a machine learning startup.

As a data engineer, I have done data analysis, data modeling, building batch data pipeline, and streaming data pipeline.
I struggled a lot in the beginning since the industry was completely different. The way people work, main focus, environment were all different. In addition to that differences, my experiences in aviation industry was not useful. 

After about 1.5 year, I was offered a job as a data analyst at IATA.
I was very fortunate to be offered for this position as I could utilize all of my knowledge and experience in aviation industry while at the same time use all the coding / developing skills that I have newly gained from working as a data engineer.

The life as a aviation data analyst in Montréal is, so far, fantastic. Not only the job is interesting and challening enough, but also the city of Montréal is charming and enjoyable.

To sum up, I felt devastated when unexpected things happened in my life, but by getting them through, they became my strength.
Now, I feel I am ready to face any challenges in life.

Thank you for reading this long story of mine whatever your reason may be.
I wish that this story of mine was interesting to you.

Have a great day.
