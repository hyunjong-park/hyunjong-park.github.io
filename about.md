Hi, my name is Hyunjong Park, a data engineer at Corca, Inc., located in Seoul, South Korea.
I started my career as a flight dispatcher at Korean Air. If you think the story of me becoming a data engineer will be interesting enough to read, you can find it below.

I started learning computer science at University of California, San Diego. San Diego is a beautiful place by the way.

But I decided to transfer to Korea Aerospace University after I finish my military duty. There were a number of reasons why I decided to do so, but my major nor the university was one of them. Anyways, I graduated with a degree in air transportation at Korea Aerospace University and started working as a flight dispatcher at [Korean Air](https://www.koreanair.com/kr/ko). Being a flight dispatcher was an interesting and intriguing as it required never-ending decision makings due to the constantly changing flight conditions.

After few years of flight plannings for pilots, I decided to become a pilot myself. I quit the job and went to a flight school in Texas. The training seemed to be going pretty well. I earned my private pilot’s license in about 3 months.

**_Well, that was only until the outbreak of COVID-19._**

The school closed down and the aviation industry went serious downfall as we all know. My plan of becoming an airline pilot was ruined. I was pretty stressed out with the whole situation. Fortunately though, I was offered to work at an airline startup in Korea, called [Air Premia](https://airpremia.com/), as a safety planning manager.

My primary job was to build a safety management system of the company. Naturally, I got to work with our IT department a lot. Seeing all the software engineers coding on a dark screen using fancy mechanical keyboards brought all the memories I had when I was studying computer science back in UCSD. I think it really lit the fire in my heart or something.

With the pandemic lasting much, much longer than everyone had expected, my eagerness to begin a new journey as a software engineer grew larger. I grabbed my old books from college and started studying C again (and python, obviously). I was not sure how to change my career to a software engineer so I called everyone I knew for an advice. After months of desperate opportunity seeking, I was lucky enough to get a chance for an interview at a machine learning startup.

Well, that was the story of how a flight dispatcher becoming a data engineer (without a few details here and there).

Though I really liked the aviation industry, I am much happier to work as a data engineer. If you are one of those people who are considering a career change, I would say ‘go for it.’

Thank you for reading this long story of mine whatever the reason may be.
I wish that my writing, my doings, or perhaps my existence somehow have been of some help to you in any way.

Have a great day.
