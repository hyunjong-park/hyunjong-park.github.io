title: About me
---

Hi, my name is Hyunjong Park. I'm a Senior Analyst, Data Science at IATA's GADM team, based in Montréal, Canada. I have a background in aviation as a former flight dispatcher at Korean Air. If you are curious about how I made this career transition and what I do now, you are in the right place!

I started learning computer science at the University of California, San Diego, which is a beautiful place by the way.

However, after completing my military duty in Korea, I decided to transfer to Korea Aerospace University and pursue a degree in air transportation. There were many reasons for this decision, but none of them had to do with my major or the university itself. Anyway, I graduated from Korea Aerospace University and landed a job as a flight dispatcher at [Korean Air](https://www.koreanair.com/). This was an interesting and challenging role that required constant decision making due to the ever-changing flight conditions.

After a few years of planning flights for pilots, I decided to follow my dream and become a pilot myself. I quit my job and went to a flight school in Texas. The training was going well and I earned my private pilot’s license in about three months.

**_Well, that was only until the outbreak of COVID-19._**


Due to the pandemic, the aviation industry took a serious downturn and the school I was attending temporarily closed down. My plans were derailed, leaving me feeling stressed and uncertain about my future. Fortunately, I was offered a position as a Safety Planning Manager at [Air Premia](https://airpremia.com/), an airline startup in Korea.

In my role, I was responsible for building the company's safety management system, which required me to work closely with the IT department. Seeing the software engineers coding on their computers brought back memories of when I studied computer science at UCSD, reigniting my passion for the field.

As the pandemic continued to disrupt the aviation industry, I began to feel a growing eagerness to explore a new career as a software engineer. I dusted off my old college textbooks and began re-studying C (and Python). However, I wasn't sure how to transition into a career in software engineering, so I sought advice from everyone I knew. After months of actively seeking opportunities, I was finally offered an interview at a machine learning startup, which I was fortunate enough to land.

As a data engineer, I have experience in data analysis, data modeling, building batch data pipelines, and streaming data pipelines. However, in the beginning, I struggled to adapt to the differences in the industry. The work culture, focus, and environment were all unfamiliar to me. To add to this, my experiences in the aviation industry proved to be of little use in my new role.

After about 1.5 years, I was offered a job as a data analyst at IATA. This was a lucky break, as it allowed me to utilize my knowledge and experience from the aviation industry, while also putting into practice the coding and development skills I had acquired as a data engineer.

Life as an aviation data analyst in Montréal has been fantastic. Not only is the job interesting and challenging, but the city itself is charming and enjoyable.

Looking back, the unexpected challenges I faced were initially devastating, but overcoming them has become a source of strength for me. I now feel ready to take on any challenges that life may throw my way.

Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I hope you found it interesting. Have a great day!
