Hi, I'm Hyunjong Park, a data engineer living in Seoul, South Korea.

I was thinking of a website with some info about me in the beginning but ended up with a blog.
Not really sure what to write about. Hopefully I'll figure it out soon.

Until then, it's only this post and _About me_.
I will come back with some posts that are worth reading.

Bye!

This blog was built with Jekyll and Kasper theme, and is hosted on GitHub.
