I recently relocated to Montréal in November 2022 to begin a new job at IATA. Although I enjoyed working as a data engineer at Corca, I was eager to utilize my extensive experience and knowledge of the aviation industry within the field of data science. However, I was initially hesitant to make such a big change in my life.

Fortunately, accepting the job at IATA in Montréal has proved to be an excellent decision. Both my work and my new life in Montréal are incredibly fulfilling and interesting. While there is a lot for me to learn, I am eager to quickly develop new skills and contribute to the promotion of global aviation safety through my work.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my recent update. Have a great day!
