I have moved to Montréal in November, 2022. It was due to my new job at IATA. 

While I really enjoyed working as a data engineer at Corca, I also wanted to utilize all of my experience and knowledge from aviation industry while still working in data science field. However, to be honest, I was little worried before moving since I knew that it will bring huge changes in my life.

It turned out that it was a such a great decision to accept the offer work at IATA in Montréal. Both the job and the life in Montréal are termendously interesting and fulfilling.

There are lots of things I need to learn, but hopefully I will learn them quickly.
I really hope to contribute to promoting the global aviation safety with my works.

Thank you for reading,
have a great day.
